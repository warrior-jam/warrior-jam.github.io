# About WarriorJam
WarriorJam is a web application that will help UH students (and staff) have their musical talents,
and interests be discovered by other people with similar interests. The app will give you
the opportunity to share your music content (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.) By using our website, you can
find and meet different people who have the same goals as you do. Who knows? You could be the next
member of a band like Coldplay, Pink Floyd, Queen, and many more.

# Project Milestones

## Milestone 1: Landing & Mockup Pages
For Milestone 1, our goal was to lay the groundwork for the project. During this time we created mockup pages of our sign in/sign out pages and also created our Landing Page:

## Milestone 2: Creating website pages
For Milestone 2, we were able to create the pages from our mockups in Milestone 1. We also were able to route the pages so that way you could navagate through the website:

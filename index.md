# About WarriorJam
WarriorJam is a web application that will help UH students (and staff) have their musical talents,
and interests be discovered by other people with similar interests. The app will give you
the opportunity to share your music content (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.) By using our website, you can
find and meet different people who have the same goals as you do. Who knows? You could be the next
member of a band like Coldplay, Pink Floyd, Queen, and many more.

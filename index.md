# Overview 
Music has always been an one of the best ways to relieve stress and the university life is surely
stressful. A lot of UH students also have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find
others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of 
informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups. 

WarriorJam is a web application that will help UH students (and staff) have their musical talents,
and interests be discovered by other people with similar interests. The app will give you
the opportunity to share your music content (YouTube, SoundCloud, etc.) By using our website, you can
find and meet different people who have the same goals as you do. Who knows? You could be the next
member of a band like Coldplay, Pink Floyd, Queen, and many more.

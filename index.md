# Overview 
Problem: Many UH students have musical talents, but there is no easy way for them to find others with similar tastes and compatible musical abilities. Thus, they cannot experience the fun of informal jam sessions which could progress into performing musical groups.

Solution: WarriorJam is a web application that will help UH students have their musical talents, and interests be discovered by other people with similar interests. The app will give the user the opportunity to share their music content (YouTube, Soundclout, etc.) WarriorJam can also be used to help a musician find a band that is suitable for them.  

# Goals of the Project
- Gain experience by working on a web application team
- Gain experience in website development 

# Goals of the App
- This app should provide a way for students to be discovered and to eventually help them achieve musical goals 
- Help starting musicians get their content out to the public

The Home Page will welcome the user to the WarriorJam website and will give the option for the user to look for a band to join or look for band members. Also the user has the option to log in to an existing profile or create an account:
